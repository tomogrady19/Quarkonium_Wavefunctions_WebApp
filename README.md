# Quarkonium_Wavefunctions_WebApp
html file to host web app to numerically solve and plot various meson wavefunctions 

Was intially a Python program to numerically solve Schrödinger’s equation for heavy mesons, modelling various quantum states using QCD approximations.
Rewritten as a html file so that it can interactively be viewed online.
